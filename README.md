### Machine Dreams

[Text](http://bach.ai/machine-dreams/)

Excerpt

> Artificial Intelligence provides a conceptual framework to understand mind and universe in new ways, clearing the obstacles that hindered the progress of philosophy and psychology. Let us see how AI can help us to understand how our minds create the experience of a universe.
> 
> Unlike the machine learning systems of the past, minds are not just classifiers or policy optimizers. Minds are not accumulators of knowledge about the world. Minds are generative systems: they actively produce the world that we subjectively experience. Ordinary day-time experiences are in fact dreams constrained by sensory data. This simple insight of contemporary cognitive science turns realist notions of embodiment on their head. The idea of the brain as a dreaming machine opens a way to understand the nature of our experiences.
> 
> This is the proposed fourth installment of a series of presentations about using AI perspectives to understand minds and their relationship to the universe. “How to build a mind” (30c3) suggested specifications for an architecture of cognition; “From computation to consciousness” (31c3) explored the mind’s computational foundations; “Computational metapsychology” (32c3) discussed the individual and social construction of meaning. “Machine dreams” sketches how the computational machinery of our brains leads to our experience a subjective world. We will look at the conductor theory of consciousness, some of the mental structures contributing to our models of self and world, and the unreasonable effectiveness of neural processes in modeling physics.


### Prime Numbers and Fractals (Serpinski Triangle)

[Math Stacks Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/371434/has-anyone-found-a-pattern-in-prime-numbers)

Excerpt

> Yesterday I was having some fun trying to look for some patterns in primes; and I think I found something interesting. The idea is to start with an array of primes {p1, p2, p3, ... }, print it, then set the value at index i = abs( [i] - [i-1] ) or put more formally, set the value at i equal to the "prime gap"; then repeat this, but use the prime gaps and find their gaps. And so on.
> 
> You can see at the top row we start with the primes, then their gaps, then their gaps, and so on. It starts to produce that triangle pattern

Excerpt from blog

> When classical Hamiltonian systems become chaotic, they don’t do it suddenly.  Almost all transitions to chaos in Hamiltonian systems are gradual.  One of the best examples of this is the KAM theory that starts with invariant action integrals that generate invariant tori in phase space.  As nonintegrable perturbations increase, the tori break up slowly into island chains of stability as chaos infiltrates the separatrixes—first as thin filaments of chaos surrounding the islands—then growing in width to take up more and more of phase space.  Even when chaos is fully developed, small islands of stability can remain—the remnants of stable orbits of the unperturbed system.
>
> When the classical becomes quantum, chaos softens.  Quantum wave functions don’t like to be confined—they spread and they tunnel.  The separatrix of classical chaos—that barrier between regions of phase space—cannot constrain the exponential tails of wave functions.  And the origin of chaos itself—the homoclinic point of the separatrix—gets washed out.  Then the regular orbits of the classical system reassert themselves, and they appear, like the vestige of the Cheshire Cat, as a grin.

### The Philosophical and Scientific Metaphysics of David Bohm

[Open Access article](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/20/7/493) by William Seager

Excerpt

> Although David Bohm’s interpretation of quantum mechanics is sometimes thought to be a kind of regression towards classical thinking, it is in fact an extremely radical metaphysics of nature. The view goes far beyond the familiar but perennially peculiar non-locality and entanglement of quantum systems. In this paper, a philosophical exploration, I examine three core features of Bohm’s metaphysical views, which have been both supported by features of quantum mechanics and integrated into a comprehensive system. These are the holistic nature of the world, the role of a unique kind of information as the ontological basis of the world, and the integration of mentality into this basis as an essential and irreducible aspect of it.

### Active Matter

[Website](https://physicsworld.com/a/active-matter-goes-chaotic/)

Excerpt

> Topological defects in the structure of materials known as active nematics can act as rods that mix the fluids – much like one might mix colours in white paint. This is the new finding from researchers at the University of California, Merced, who say that the mixing is a result of sliding on a molecular scale. The work, which has applied chaotic advection to the emerging field of active matter for the first time, could help advance our fundamental understanding of how defects move collectively in liquid crystals.
> 
> Nature abounds with examples of active matter, with some well-known examples being flocks of birds, fish and insects, sheets of biological cells and swarms of bacteria. Researchers have been trying to make biomimetic and synthetic active materials in the laboratory from materials such as self-propelled colloids and dense phases of mechanically driven biopolymers. Needless to say, they would like to better understand the fundamental physics of these systems.

[First Book on Active Matter](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262036801/active-matter/)

Introduction

> The past few decades brought a revolution in computer software and hardware; today we are on the cusp of a materials revolution. If yesterday we programmed computers and other machines, today we program matter itself. This has created new capabilities in design, computing, and fabrication, which allow us to program proteins and bacteria, to generate self-transforming wood products and architectural details, and to create clothing from “intelligent textiles” that grow themselves. This book offers essays and sample projects from the front lines of the emerging field of active matter.


### Microbial cloud

[Paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4582947/)

Abstract

> Dispersal of microbes between humans and the built environment can occur through direct contact with surfaces or through airborne release; the latter mechanism remains poorly understood. Humans emit upwards of 10⁶ biological particles per hour, and have long been known to transmit pathogens to other individuals and to indoor surfaces. However it has not previously been demonstrated that humans emit a detectible microbial cloud into surrounding indoor air, nor whether such clouds are sufficiently differentiated to allow the identification of individual occupants. We used high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes to characterize the airborne bacterial contribution of a single person sitting in a sanitized custom experimental climate chamber. We compared that to air sampled in an adjacent, identical, unoccupied chamber, as well as to supply and exhaust air sources. Additionally, we assessed microbial communities in settled particles surrounding each occupant, to investigate the potential long-term fate of airborne microbial emissions. Most occupants could be clearly detected by their airborne bacterial emissions, as well as their contribution to settled particles, within 1.5–4 h. Bacterial clouds from the occupants were statistically distinct, allowing the identification of some individual occupants. Our results confirm that an occupied space is microbially distinct from an unoccupied one, and demonstrate for the first time that individuals release their own personalized microbial cloud.

### Swarm decision-making

[2010 Research](http://www2.ece.ohio-state.edu/~passino/PapersToPost/GrpDecMakHoneyBees-AmSci.pdf)

Conclusion (summary):
1. Diversity of knowledge. Bees gather information regardless of its quality, and bring back information for collective evaluation.
2. No comformity / independent evaluation. Each bee will verify the site's suitability and dance to the true extent of its suitability to advertise said site.
3. Allows balanced behaviors to emerge (a long qorum-sensing process that eliminates edge and extreme opinions)
